# Understanding Slugs and URLs in Storyblok: API, Visual Editor, and Public URLs

When working with Storyblok, it's crucial to differentiate between the structure of the:

- **story's slug** used by the Content Delivery API;
- URL for the **Visual Editor** (named Preview URL);
- **public URL** presented to end users.



## The most common scenario (the simplest)

The public URL presented to end users depends on how your frontend is designed to interpret and render content. In the simplest scenario, the URL path is directly used as the slug for the story.

For example, in a standard scenario where the URL is `domain.com/articles/article-1`, the frontend can simply extract the URL path `articles/article-1` and use it as the story slug to retrieve the corresponding content.

However, in a more structured scenario, such as having two different domains (`domain1.com` and `domain2.com`), each domain might serve content from distinct folders. For instance:

- **`domain1.com`** uses stories stored in the `folder1` folder.
- **`domain2.com`** uses stories stored in the `folder2` folder.

In this case, you need to implement mapping rules or roles in your frontend's routing logic to ensure the correct folder is referenced when retrieving stories.

The following explanation will guide you on how to handle this more complex scenario effectively.

Here's a breakdown.

## 1. **Slug in the Content Delivery API**

The slug used for retrieving a single Story via  the Content Delivery API reflects the story's location within the Storyblok folder structure. For example:

```bash
/folder1/subfolder1/story1
```

This slug is independent of any language settings. The language with the Content Delivery API  is passed separately as a query parameter (e.g., `language=it`), ensuring the same slug can retrieve language-specific content.

## 2. **URL in the Visual Editor**

The Visual Editor URL in Storyblok (the Preview URL) may include the language code depending on the context:

- **Default Language:** The language code is omitted, e.g., `/folder1/subfolder1/story1`.
- **Specific Language:** The language code is prefixed, e.g., `/it/folder1/subfolder1/story1`.

This structure allows content editors to preview content in different languages directly within the editor.

## 3. **Public URL for end-users**

The public URL presented to end users depends on how your frontend is designed to interpret and render content. In the simplest scenario, the URL path is used as a slug for the Story. If you need a specific and custom behavior/mapping, you can apply a specific logic. For example:

- Assume that all content for `domain1.com` is stored in the `folder1` folder in Storyblok.
- The frontend uses a "strong assumption" to map the `folder1` folder as the base for the public domain.

In this scenario, the public URL might look like:

```bash
domain1.com/subfolder1/story1
```

Hereâ€™s how this is mapped:

- The frontend interprets the browser URL path `/subfolder1/story1` as corresponding to the story with the slug `/folder1/subfolder1/story1`.
- The domain or user preferences infer the language (e.g., `it` or `de` ...) (or from the first part of the path in the Public URL, for example, `domain1.com/it/subfolder1/story1`).

------

## Why This Matters

By understanding these distinctions:

1. You can optimize API calls by passing only necessary parameters (e.g., slugs and language codes).
2. Editors can preview language-specific content intuitively in the Visual Editor.
3. End users experience clean, user-friendly URLs, even when content is stored in a deeply structured hierarchy.

This approach ensures a seamless experience for developers, editors, and users while maintaining content organization and multilingual support flexibility.
